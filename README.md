Clapet is a utility that aims to improve clamshell mode on your Macbook.

Clamshell mode on mac keeps your mac awake when you close the lid but it 
only works when a power adapter is connected. This app aims to solve this
problem by allowing clamshell mode even on battery.

When an external display is detected while on battery or power adapter, the application will 
disable sleep so you can use your computer with the lid closed, and as soon as the external 
display is unplugged, sleep will be enabled again to preserve battery.
